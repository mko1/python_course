# python_course

This repository contains all my learnings in data analyse with the most popular python libraries. I would like to provide code snippets and whole projects.

This course is focused on development, sort and compress data with python. A big part of this course are financial analyse which we are use in our fintech startup. Libraries like PANDAS, NUMPY and iPython are our main resource for our work.
